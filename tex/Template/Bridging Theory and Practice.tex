%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Continuous-time models based on Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) offer a theoretically 
elegant solution for modeling sporadically-observed time series, a common challenge in fields like healthcare. 
The GRU-ODE-Bayes model represents a state-of-the-art approach, combining the continuous dynamics of an ODE solver with 
discrete updates inspired by Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). 
This paper presents a deep, practical investigation into the implementation and performance of the GRU-ODE-Bayes model on 
real-world physiological datasets. 
We detail a systematic journey of optimization, from robust data engineering to vectorized implementation, 
to make the model trainable. Our investigation reveals two surprising findings. 
First, due to the significant overhead of the adjoint-based ODE solver for sequential, short-interval tasks, 
a CPU-based training pipeline significantly outperforms its GPU counterpart. 
Second, and more critically, a simpler baseline model that omits the ODE component entirely is not only 
orders of magnitude faster to train (30 seconds vs. 1 hour per epoch) but also achieves substantially higher 
classification accuracy (97.78\% vs. 62\%). 
These results challenge the practical utility of the added complexity of the GRU-ODE-Bayes architecture for 
classification tasks on this type of data, highlighting a crucial gap between theoretical promise and empirical performance.
