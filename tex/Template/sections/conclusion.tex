\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we documented the implementation, optimization, and critical evaluation of the GRU-ODE-Bayes model. 
Through a rigorous process, we successfully trained the model on real-world physiological data, but discovered that its 
complexity was its downfall. 
A simpler baseline without the continuous-time ODE component was vastly superior in both speed and accuracy. 
Our work underscores the importance of empirical validation and the principle of Occam's razor in machine learning:
a simpler model that performs better is the better model. 
While Neural ODEs remain a powerful tool, particularly for learning physical dynamics, 
their application requires careful consideration of the problem's nature and a thorough 
comparison against strong, simpler baselines.
